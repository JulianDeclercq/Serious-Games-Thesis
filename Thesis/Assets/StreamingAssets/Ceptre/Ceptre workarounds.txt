if a stage has to transfer after firing a particular rule:
	add a PARTICULAR_RULE_TOKEN to the beginning of EVERY RULE in the stage.
	only the PARTICULAR_RULE consumes the PARTICULAR_RULE_TOKEN.

	Example: After the visit rule is executed, the stage has to end
	stage mainStage = {
	% From any location, redhood can visit any characters house
	visit : hasntVisited * at redhood L * house C L' -o visit redhood C * at redhood L' * houseToken.

	wolfEncounter : $hasntVisited * wolfNotEncountered * at wolf woods * $at redhood woods -o at wolf granny_house.
	eat 			: $hasntVisited * $at wolf woods * at C woods -o dead C.
	fightWolf 		: $hasntVisited * at C woods * at wolf woods -o fightToken C woods.
	gets_lost 		: $hasntVisited * at C woods -o.
	wander_in_woods : $hasntVisited * at C woods -o at C woods.}

	Note the hasntVisited pred. a the start of all rules
	Consuming this token with the visit rule makes sure the other rules can't be run, and thus forcing the stage into quiescense


	CHECK IF L AND L' CAN BE THE SAME, THINK THEY CAN THO OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE AMAZE, SEEMS TO WORK!!!!
