From Gwen Bosser:

Hi Chris,

Sorry for answering so late: January has been a time hole, I'm still
recovering! Below is an example of specification of sequence of events in the
novel Madame Bovary. 

I would be interested to see what you can obtain from it in Celf: I have been
reading a bit around mixing backtracking and forward chaining in LL in a
language (LolliMon? How close to Celf is it?). 

One thing I am particularly interested in is: Can you, by mixing forward
chaining on "causal chain" and backward as needed to identify causal paths for
creating "missing" resources for executing the next forward action. This would
allow to naturally extract, from a verbose specification, causally structured
"sub-stories". It's very interesting to be able to do this at runtime, and
causality is a huge beast in AI research, even though narrative causality is a
special case!

(I have still to read some of the papers you recommended, but I'm on my way to
have that stack destroyed.)

The example below may not exactly match/illustrate what Celf has to give.
Perhaps it is too "driven". Maybe we can have a short chat soon to discuss this
further?
