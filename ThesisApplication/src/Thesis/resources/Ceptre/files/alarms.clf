% Coding up "alarms" as a mechanism for locally handling global time.
% Processes that refer to time at time T set alarms for time (T+N), where N
% is the amount of time, and release a new atom into the context when time
% has advanced to match that time.

% clock, phase, from the "what happens within a single timestep", or
% interphase.
